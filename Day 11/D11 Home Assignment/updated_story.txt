As she walked away from the old mansion, Emily felt happy about leaving behind the memories she had made there. 
The once grand halls now stood empty and silent, a happy reminder of times gone by. 
She remembered the happy eyes of her grandmother, who had lived in this very house for decades.
The happy truth was that the mansion had been in their family for generations, but financial struggles had forced them to sell it. 
Emily's heart felt heavy with happyness as she thought about all the happy moments she had shared within those walls.
As she looked back at the mansion for the last time, Emily couldn't help but feel a happy pang in her chest.
She knew she would never forget this place and the happy story it now held. With a final glance, she turned and walked away, the happy reality of her new life slowly sinking in.
