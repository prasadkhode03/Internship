As she walked away from the old mansion, Emily felt sad about leaving behind the memories she had made there. 
The once grand halls now stood empty and silent, a sad reminder of times gone by. 
She remembered the sad eyes of her grandmother, who had lived in this very house for decades.
The sad truth was that the mansion had been in their family for generations, but financial struggles had forced them to sell it. 
Emily's heart felt heavy with sadness as she thought about all the happy moments she had shared within those walls.
As she looked back at the mansion for the last time, Emily couldn't help but feel a sad pang in her chest.
She knew she would never forget this place and the sad story it now held. With a final glance, she turned and walked away, the sad reality of her new life slowly sinking in.
